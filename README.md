Flaming Archer
==============

Flaming Archer is a photo-a-day application I put together to learn the [Slim PHP micro framework](http://www.slimframework.com/).  The application has expanded to learning Puppet, rspec, Twig, and Composer.  I'm sure I'll find a way to stuff a lot more in there before I'm done.
